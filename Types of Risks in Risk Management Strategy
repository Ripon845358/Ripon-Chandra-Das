Types of Risks in Risk Management Strategy
1. Credit Risk
• 	Impact:
• 	Losses due to borrowers or counterparties failing to meet obligations.
• 	Can lead to defaults, reduced profitability, and reputational damage.
• 	Methods of Reducing Impact:
• 	Diversification of loan portfolios.
• 	Credit scoring and rating systems.
• 	Collateral and guarantees.
• 	Regular monitoring of borrower financial health.
• 	Quantification:
• 	Probability of Default (PD): Likelihood borrower will default.
• 	Loss Given Default (LGD): Expected loss if default occurs.
• 	Exposure at Default (EAD): Total value at risk.
• 	Combined into Expected Loss (EL = PD × LGD × EAD).

2. Liquidity Risk
• 	Impact:
• 	Inability to meet short-term obligations due to insufficient liquid assets.
• 	Can trigger insolvency, forced asset sales, or regulatory breaches.
• 	Methods of Reducing Impact:
• 	Maintaining adequate cash reserves.
• 	Establishing committed credit lines.
• 	Stress testing under adverse scenarios.
• 	Asset-liability management (ALM) to balance maturities.
• 	Quantification:
• 	Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR): High-quality liquid assets vs. net cash outflows.
• 	Net Stable Funding Ratio (NSFR): Stable funding vs. required funding.
• 	Gap analysis of inflows vs. outflows.

3. Legal Risk
• 	Impact:
• 	Losses from unenforceable contracts, regulatory penalties, or litigation.
• 	Can damage reputation and lead to financial sanctions.
• 	Methods of Reducing Impact:
• 	Strong compliance frameworks.
• 	Regular legal audits and contract reviews.
• 	Clear documentation and adherence to jurisdictional laws.
• 	Insurance coverage for litigation risks.
• 	Quantification:
• 	Difficult to measure precisely; often assessed via:
• 	Scenario analysis (estimating potential fines/lawsuits).
• 	Historical loss data from legal disputes.
• 	Provisioning for contingent liabilities.

⚠️ Key Considerations
• 	Interconnectedness: Credit and liquidity risks are often linked—defaults reduce liquidity, while liquidity shortages increase credit risk.
• 	Quantification Challenge: Legal risk is hardest to measure; firms rely on qualitative assessments and provisioning.
• 	Best Practice: Combine quantitative models (for credit/liquidity) with qualitative frameworks (for legal) to build a holistic risk management strategy.
